# SFUSD-Survey-Analysis

In this project, I analyze the responses of a survey sent out to San Francisco Unified School District community members. The survey asked respondents about their thoughts on the proposed school closure process in order to determine which factors to consider when identifying candidates for closures, consolidations, and mergers. The goal of this project is to determine which populations are over/under-represented and understand the concerns of community members. 

I use R to summarize the demographics and map the geographic distribution of responses.

##Key Findings:
The lack of responses for many of the questions makes estimates of survey responses challenging. The racial identities, affiliations with the district, education levels, and zip codes were missing for large proportions of the respondents. The data we have does not appear to capture a wide geographic and cultural spectrum of the SFUSD community.

- White individuals were disproportionately represented among respondents to the survey, while several minority communities, such as African Americans, were underrepresented.
- While there was no precise measure of socioeconomic status in the survey, of those who chose to indicate, around 38% of respondents held a graduate or professional degree. Followed by 31.3% with a Bachelorâ€™s degree, and 7.2% with some high school or less. The rest of respondents either had their high school diploma/GED, Associates degree, or some college with no degree. Given that the survey respondents primarily held graduate or professional degrees, it suggests a relatively high level of education amongst the survey respondents.
- The majority of respondents seem to reside in the Ingleside-Excelsior and Crocker-Amazon neighborhoods (94112). The next most-represented neighborhoods by proportion of respondents are Inner Mission/Bernal Heights (94110) and Sunset (94122). The least represented neighborhoods include the Presidio, Marina District (94123), Chinatown (94108), and the South Beach/Financial District areas (94104, 94105).
