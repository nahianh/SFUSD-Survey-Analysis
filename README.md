# SFUSD-Survey-Analysis

In this project, I analyze the responses of a survey sent out to San Francisco Unified School District community members. The survey asked respondents about their thoughts on the proposed school closure process in order to determine which factors to consider when identifying candidates for closures, consolidations, and mergers. The goal of this project is to determine which populations are over/under-represented and understand the concerns of community members. 

I use R to summarize the demographics and map the geographic distribution of responses.
